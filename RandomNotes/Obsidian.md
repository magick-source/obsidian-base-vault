[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is an open source, extensible note taking application.

It does have Linux, MacOs, Windows, Android and iOS apps, and it also have a premium service to synchronize notes. 

Notes can also be synchronized using any other mechanism to copy files between computers - personally I use dropbox and/or google drive to copy files between systems.

Because I like to keep notes and tasks around, and I don't like mixing my personal notes with notes from my jobs/clients, I often create new vaults.

To simplify the creation of new vaults I set up  this project, which I'm calling #projects/obsidian-base-vault
